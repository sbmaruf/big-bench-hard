The second letter: ""mirage"": ""i"" (9), ""miltonic"": ""i"" (9). We now have: (2) ""biennial"" < (3) [""creedal"" < ""cry""] < (5) ""eyesight"" < (6) [""fletch"" < ""fraudulent""] < (9) [""mirage"" = ""miltonic""] < (10) ""j"" < (20) ""titmice"" < (23) ""whisper"".
Hence, we have: ""biennial"" < [""creedal"" < ""cry""] < ""eyesight"" < [""fletch"" < ""fraudulent""] < [""mirage"" = ""miltonic""] < ""j"" < ""titmice"" < ""whisper"". So the answer is biennial creedal cry eyesight fletch fraudulent mirage miltonic j titmice whisper.",biennial creedal cry eyesight fletch fraudulent j miltonic mirage titmice whisper
