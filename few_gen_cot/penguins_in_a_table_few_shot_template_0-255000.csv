A: Let's think step by step.","This question focuses on age and height. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old and 50 cm tall; Bernard is 5 years old and 80 cm tall; Vincent is 9 years old and 60 cm tall; and Gwen is 8 years old and 70 cm tall.
We need to find a penguin that is younger than Gwen but taller than her. That means we need to look for a penguin with an age less than 8 and a height greater than 70 cm.
The only penguin that meets these conditions is Louis. He is younger than Gwen (age 7) and taller than her (height 50 cm > 70 cm).
So the penguin that is younger but taller than Gwen is Louis. The answer is (A).",(B)
