Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ { [
A: Let's think step by step.
We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: [ ; stack: [
2: { ; stack: [ {
3: [ ; stack: [ { [
Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is ""[ { ["".
We will need to pop out ""["", ""{"", ""["" one by one in that order.
So, we need ""]"", ""}"", ""]"". So the answer is ] } ].

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: < > ( ( [ [ ( { } ) [ < > ] ]
A: Let's think step by step.
We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is ""( ( ["".
We will need to pop out ""["", ""("", ""("" one by one in that order.
So, we need ""]"", "")"", "")"". So the answer is ] ) ).

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: < [ < [ { < [ ] < { } > > } ] > { { ( ) } { < [ < > ] > }
A: Let's think step by step.
We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: < ; stack: <

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is ""< [ {"".
We will need to pop out ""{"", ""["", ""<"" one by one in that order.
So, we need ""}"", ""]"", "">"". So the answer is } ] >.

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: < < < > >
A: Let's think step by step.","We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: < ; stack: <
2: < ; stack: < <
3: < ; stack: < < <

5: > ; stack: <
Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is ""<"".
We will need to pop out ""<"" one by one in order.
So, the answer is <<<>>> or <<<<>>>>. Both are correct.",>
