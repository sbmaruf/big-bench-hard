"Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.
Options:
(A) The patient had a skin condition
(B) The specialist had a skin condition
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the patient and the specialist. The verb phrase ""referred to"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the patient and Y the specialist. The sentence is then of the form ""X was referred to Y because (X or Y) had a rare skin condition.""
Let's consider X first: ""X was referred to Y because X had a rare skin condition."" This case makes sense, because the patient is the one seeking medical treatment due to their rare skin condition.
Now, consider Y: ""X was referred to Y because Y had a rare skin condition."" This case does not make sense, because it does not explain why the specialist was the one who was referred to in the sentence.
Because in this context, X is the patient and Y is the specialist, the answer should be the patient. So the answer is (A).",(A)

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The verb phrase ""told ... a fake story"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the writer and Y the salesperson. The sentence is then of the form ""X tried to fool Y and told (X or Y) a fake story.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X tried to fool Y and told Y a fake story."" This case makes sense, because X wanted to deceive Y, so telling Y a fake story fits with the intention.
Now, consider X: ""X tried to fool Y and told X a fake story."" This case does not make much sense, because X was the one who initiated the deception, so they would not need to tell themself a fake story.
Because in this context, X is the writer and Y is the salesperson, the answer should be the salesperson. So the answer is (B).",(B)

(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.

The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's.

Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.

Finally, consider Z: ""This story could not be published without X and Y's support."" This case doesn't make sense, as there is no evidence in the sentence that Z might have friends who supported the publication of their story.

The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.

(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Now, consider X: ""X called Y to inform him that X's car would be ready in the morning."" This case does not make sense, because if it were X's car that was in the shop, X would not need to call Y to inform them that it would be ready.
Because in this context, X is the mechanic and Y is the customer, the answer should be the customer. So the answer is (B).",(B)

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The verb ""broke"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the driver and Y the tailor. The sentence is then of the form ""X yelled at Y after (X or Y) broke a window.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X yelled at Y after Y broke a window."" This case doesn't make sense, because if Y broke a window, it would be more likely that X would be yelling at Y for breaking the window, rather than the other way around.
Now, consider X: ""X yelled at Y after X broke a window."" This case makes sense, because if X broke a window, Y might yell at X in response.
Because of the causality in the sentence, X is the driver and Y is the tailor. So the answer is (A).",(C)

Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks.
Options:
(A) The carpenter had been working on the house
(B) The onlooker had been working on the house
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the carpenter and the onlooker. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the carpenter and Y the onlooker. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) had been working on the house for three weeks.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y had been working on the house for three weeks."" This case doesn't make much sense, because an onlooker is typically someone who watches but doesn't actually participate in the work being done on the house.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X had been working on the house for three weeks."" This makes sense, because X is a carpenter who might be working on a house for a certain amount of time.
Because in this context, X is the carpenter and Y is the onlooker, the answer should be the carpenter. So the answer is (A).",(A)

Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support.
Options:
(A) They were the writer's friends
(B) They were the friends' friends
(C) They were the story's friends
(D) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" might be referring to, as well as the referent for ""their"" (which refers to ""her friends'""). There are multiple possible referents for both pronouns. Let X be the writer and Y be the friends. The sentence is then of the form ""This story could not be published without (X and Y)'s support.""
Let's consider ""her"" first: ""This story could not be published without X and Y's support."" This case makes sense, because X and Y are both needed to support the publication of the story, and ""her"" could refer to X as the writer.
However, let's consider ""their"": ""This story could not be published without X and Y's support."" This case is ambiguous because we don't know who ""their"" refers to. It could either refer to X and Y together or it could only refer to Y's friends who are also supporting the publication of the story.
Without a clear referent for ""their"", we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (D).",(A)

The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Now, consider X: ""X called Y to inform X that X's car would be ready in the morning."" This case doesn't make much sense, as it suggests that the mechanic would be notifying themselves about their own car.

Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Now, consider X: ""X collaborates with Y, and X shares a story."" This case doesn't make much sense, because it is difficult to imagine how X collaborating with Y would cause X to share a story.
Because in this context, Y is the artist and the sentence implies that Y is sharing a story as a result of their collaboration with X (the scientist), the answer should be the artist. So the answer is (B).",(C)

Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.
Options:

(B) The cashier needed to understand
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""she"", namely the lawyer and the cashier. The verb ""looked into"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the lawyer and Y the cashier. The sentence is then of the form ""X looked into (something) about Y, because (X or Y) needed to understand the case.""
Let's consider X first: ""X looked into something about Y, because X needed to understand the case."" This case doesn't make sense, because the reason X looked into something about Y was because Y was under investigation, not because X needed to understand the case.
Now, consider Y: ""X looked into something about Y, because Y needed to understand the case."" This case makes sense, because Y was the subject of the investigation and needed to know what was happening.
Because Y is the only possible referent in this context, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is the cashier. So the answer is (B).",(A)

The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""

Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The visitor tells the teacher that he likes the cake.
Options:
(A) The visitor likes the cake
(B) The teacher likes the cake
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the visitor and the teacher. The verb ""likes"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the visitor and Y the teacher. The sentence is then of the form ""X tells Y that (X or Y) likes the cake.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X tells Y that Y likes the cake."" This case doesn't make sense, because it would be strange for the visitor to be telling the teacher that the teacher likes a cake without any further context.
Now, consider X: ""X tells Y that X likes the cake."" This case makes sense, because the visitor is expressing their own preference for the cake.
Because in this context, X is the visitor and Y is the teacher, the answer should be the visitor. So the answer is (A).",(A)

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""she"", namely the undergraduate and the scientist. The verb ""needed"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the undergraduate and Y the scientist. The sentence is then of the form ""X applied to work with Y because (X or Y) needed an assistant.""
Let's consider X first: ""X applied to work with Y because X needed an assistant."" This case does not make much sense, because why would X apply to work with someone else if all X needed was an assistant? It's more likely that X applied to work with Y because Y needed an assistant, which means that X would have the opportunity to become one.
Now, consider Y: ""X applied to work with Y because Y needed an assistant."" This case makes sense, because Y might have needed someone to help in the lab.
Because in this context, X is the undergraduate and Y is the scientist, the answer should be the scientist. So the answer is (B).",(B)

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The sentence is then of the form ""After meeting with Y, X goes to (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""After meeting with Y, X goes to Y's office."" This case doesn't make sense, as Sam shouldn't be going to the producers' office after meeting with them.
Now, consider X: ""After meeting with Y, X goes to X's office."" This case makes sense, because Sam going to his own office is a logical next step after meeting with the producers.
Because X is the only reasonable option in this context, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is Sam. So the answer is (A).",(A)

A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Now, consider Y: ""After meeting with X, Y will go to Y's office."" This case makes sense, because after the meeting with the producers, Sam might want to go back to his own office.
Because only Sam makes sense as the antecedent of the pronoun, we conclude that the answer is (B).",(B)

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""she"", namely the carpenter and the onlooker. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the carpenter and Y the onlooker. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) had been working on the house for three weeks.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y had been working on the house for three weeks."" This case doesn't make sense, because Y is an onlooker and wouldn't have been working on the house.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X had been working on the house for three weeks."" This case makes sense, because it's likely that the carpenter had been working on the house for three weeks if they were telling the onlooker about it.
Because in this context, X is the carpenter and Y is the onlooker, the answer should be the carpenter. So the answer is (A).",(A)

A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""she"", namely the homeowner and the inspector. The verb ""purchased"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the homeowner and Y the inspector. The sentence is then of the form ""X asked Y if the house (X or Y) had purchased was structurally sound.""
Let's consider X first: ""X asked Y if the house X had purchased was structurally sound."" This case makes sense, because X is the homeowner and would have purchased the house in question.
Now, consider Y: ""X asked Y if the house Y had purchased was structurally sound."" This case doesn't make as much sense, because Y is the inspector and it is less likely that they would have purchased the house in question.
Because in this context, X is the homeowner and Y is the inspector, the answer should be the homeowner. So the answer is (A).",(A)

The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.

(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The customer and the chef discussed her culinary training.
Options:

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""her"", namely the customer and the chef. The verb ""discussed"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the customer and Y the chef. The sentence is then of the form ""X and Y discussed (X or Y)'s culinary training.""
Let's consider X first: ""X and Y discussed X's culinary training."" This case doesn't make much sense, because why would the chef be discussing the customer's culinary training? It's more likely that the customer would be discussing their own culinary training with the chef.
Now, consider Y: ""X and Y discussed Y's culinary training."" This case makes more sense, because the chef talking about their own culinary training with the customer seems more plausible.
Because the chef is the only plausible referent for ""her"", we can conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is the chef. So the answer is (B).",(B)

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""them"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""them"", namely the secretary and the analyst. The verb ""helped"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the secretary and Y the analyst. The sentence is then of the form ""X came to Y's office and helped (X or Y) to book a flight.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X came to Y's office and helped Y to book a flight."" This case doesn't make much sense, because why would X help Y book a flight? It seems more likely that X was the one who needed the help.
Now, consider X: ""X came to Y's office and helped X to book a flight."" This case makes sense, because X might need the assistance of Y to book a flight.
Because in this context, X is the secretary and Y is the analyst, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).",(B)

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.

The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.

Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office

(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""

Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.

The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The sentence is then of the form ""X showed Y something and asked (him/her) for feedback.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X showed Y something and asked Y for feedback."" This case doesn't make sense, because Y wouldn't be asking themselves for feedback.
Now, consider X: ""X showed Y something and asked X for feedback."" This case also doesn't make sense, because X is the one doing the showing, not the one who needs feedback.
Because ""her"" doesn't match either X or Y, we can conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).",(B)

Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.

The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.

(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

The sentence is then of the form ""X showed Y something and asked (X or Y) for feedback.""

Now, consider X: ""X showed Y something and asked X for feedback."" This case does not make much sense, as the designer already has the blueprint, so it wouldn't make sense to ask for feedback from themselves.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""they"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""they"", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb ""told"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form ""X told Y that (X or Y) did something.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X told Y that Y did something."" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: ""X told Y that X did something."" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs ""sent"" and ""reply"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form ""X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet."" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The nurse stayed away from the laborer because he was very busy.
Options:
(A) The nurse was busy
(B) The laborer was busy
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""he"", namely the nurse and the laborer. The verb ""busy"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the nurse and Y the laborer. The sentence is then of the form ""X stayed away from Y because (X or Y) was very busy.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X stayed away from Y because Y was very busy."" This case makes sense, because Y could be very busy with work or another task.
Now, consider X: ""X stayed away from Y because X was very busy."" This case doesn't make much sense, because as a nurse, X's job is to attend to the laborer. It wouldn't make sense for X to avoid the laborer because X is busy.
Because in this context, Y is the laborer and X is the nurse, the answer should be the laborer. So the answer is (B).",(C)

Now, consider X: ""X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet."" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""his"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""his"", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase ""plan to meet"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form ""X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X will plan to meet Y at Y's office."" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: ""X will plan to meet Y at X's office."" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave them some tips.
Options:
(A) Gave the chief some tips
(B) Gave the housekeeper some tips
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.","Here we need to determine who the pronoun ""them"" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for ""them"", namely the chief and the housekeeper. The verbs ""thanked"" and ""gave"" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the housekeeper. The sentence is then of the form ""X thanked Y and gave (X or Y) some tips.""
Let's consider Y first: ""X thanked Y and gave Y some tips."" This case makes sense, because the housekeeper might have provided some kind of service that the chief appreciated and wanted to reward with some tips.
Now, consider X: ""X thanked Y and gave X some tips."" This case doesn't make much sense, because it is unlikely that the chief would give themselves any tips.
Because in this context, Y is the housekeeper and X is the chief, the answer should be the housekeeper. So the answer is (B).",(B)
