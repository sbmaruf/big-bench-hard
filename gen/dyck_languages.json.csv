Now the stack contains `[`. - Next, we find a `<`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <`. - Then we find a `[`. We push it onto the stack again. Now the stack contains `[, <, [`. - Moving forward, we find a `]`. We check the top of the stack. It contains `[`. So we can pop the `[` from the stack and continue. Now the stack contains `[, <`. - The next bracket is `<`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <, <`. - The next bracket is `]`. We check the top of the stack. It contains `<`. We cannot pop `<` from the stack to match with the `]`. So this is an invalid sequence and we can stop processing further.  Hence the output is Invalid.   However, let's say the input was [ < { [ ( ) ] } > ] ( { } ). This is how the processing would go:  - Starting from the leftmost bracket, we find a `[`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[`. - Next, we find a `<`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <`. - Then we find a `{`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <, {`. - The next bracket is `[`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <, {, [`. - The next bracket is `(`. We push it onto the stack. Now the stack contains `[, <, {, [, (`.  ...and so on.   In the end, we can pop all the brackets and check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the sequence is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid."

They are a pair of opening and closing brackets. - The next symbols are < and {. They are also a pair of opening brackets. - Then we encounter >, which is a closing bracket. It matches with the opening bracket <. - The next symbol is }. It is a closing bracket that matches with the opening bracket {. - Finally, we encounter ( and ). They are a pair of opening and closing parentheses. - The sequence ends with ]. The opening bracket [ does not have a matching closing bracket, but this does not matter because it is not nested within any other brackets or parentheses.  Since all brackets and parentheses have been matched properly, the sequence is valid."
