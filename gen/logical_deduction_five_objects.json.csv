Explanation:  From the given statements, we know that the green book is the rightmost and the purple book is to the left of the yellow book. Therefore, the order from right to left is: green book, ?, ?, ? , purple book.  Also, we know that the gray book is to the right of the orange book and to the left of the purple book. Therefore, the order from right to left is now: green book, purple book, gray book, ?, orange book.  Since there are only two books left, we can deduce that the yellow book must be in the second position from the left, leaving the gray book in the second position from the right.

(D) The plums are the second-cheapest
(E) The pears are the second-cheapest",(A),"The answer is (C) The oranges are the second-cheapest.

However, we also know that the apples are less expensive than the mangoes and the pears are more expensive than the oranges. Therefore, the oranges must be the second-cheapest since they are more expensive than the cheapest (plums) and less expensive than the third-cheapest (apples)."

(C) The hawk is the second from the left
(D) The robin is the second from the left
(E) The quail is the second from the left",(D),"Based on the given information, we know that the order from left to right is: __, robin, __, __, hawk, where the blank spaces represent the crow, the falcon, and the quail (not necessarily in that order). We also know that the quail is to the left of the hawk, so that eliminates choices (C) and (D) because they place the hawk in the middle. We also know that the robin is to the right of the falcon, so that eliminates choice (B) because it places the robin in the middle. Finally, we know that the robin is the second from the left, so that eliminates choice (A) because it would place the crow in that position. Therefore, the answer is (E) The quail is the second from the left."

(D) The convertible is the second-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the second-oldest",(B),"The answer is (C) The bus is the second-oldest.   We know that the minivan is the newest, so it can't be the second-oldest. We also know that the motorcycle is older than the bus, so it can't be the second-oldest either. The hatchback is newer than the convertible, so it can't be older than the convertible. Therefore, the only option left is that the bus is the second-oldest."

(C) The white book is the second from the right
(D) The purple book is the second from the right
(E) The yellow book is the second from the right",(B),"The answer is (B) The blue book is the second from the right.   Since the blue book is to the right of the yellow book and the purple book is the second from the left, it must be that the green book is the leftmost book and the white book is to the left of the yellow book. Thus, the order from left to right is: green book, white book, yellow book, blue book, purple book. Therefore, the blue book is indeed the second book from the right."

(B) The peaches are the cheapest
(C) The pears are the cheapest
(D) The plums are the cheapest
(E) The watermelons are the cheapest",(A),"The answer is (E) The watermelons are the cheapest.  This is because the watermelons are the most expensive, and all the other fruits are less expensive than the watermelons. Therefore, none of them can be the most cheap."

(C) The watermelons are the second-cheapest
(D) The pears are the second-cheapest
(E) The mangoes are the second-cheapest",(B),"The answer is (D) The pears are the second-cheapest.   If the apples are the third-most expensive, then there are two fruits that are more expensive than the apples. We know that the pears are more expensive than the watermelons, so the pears must be one of the two fruits that are more expensive than the apples. Therefore, the pears cannot be the most expensive or the cheapest.   We also know that the oranges are more expensive than the mangoes. Since the apples are more expensive than the oranges, the apples cannot be the cheapest fruit, which means that the mangoes must be the cheapest.   Therefore, the order from most expensive to cheapest is:  1. Unknown (more expensive than apples and pears) 2. Pears 3. Apples 4. Oranges 5. Mangoes   Out of the given options, the second-cheapest fruit is the one that comes right before the apples, which is the pears."

(D) The hummingbird is the second from the right
(E) The robin is the second from the right",(E),"The answer is (E) The robin is the second from the right.   We know that the cardinal is the rightmost, so the other four birds must be arranged from left to right. The hummingbird is the third from the left, which means the raven and owl must be to its left. And since the raven is to the left of the owl, the order from left to right must be: raven, owl, hummingbird, robin, cardinal. Therefore, the robin is the second from the right."

Options:
(A) Eve finished last
(B) Amy finished last
(C) Ada finished last
(D) Rob finished last
(E) Joe finished last",(D),"Option (D) Rob finished last.   Since Amy finished second-to-last, there is only one person who finished after her, which is the last place. Therefore, (A) Eve finished last and (B) Amy finished last are both contradictory.   Rob finished below Eve, which means Rob finished either second-to-last or last. However, Ada finished above Joe, meaning that Rob couldn't have finished last (because then Ada wouldn't have been able to finish above Joe). Therefore, Rob must have finished second-to-last.

Brown book 2. Black book 3. Gray book 4. Yellow book 5. Purple book  We know that the brown book is the leftmost, so it must be all the way to the left. The black book is the third from the left, so it must be in the middle of the shelf. The yellow book is to the right of the purple book, and the black book is to the left of the purple book, so the purple book must be in the middle with the black book on one side and the yellow book on the other. That leaves the gray book to the right of the yellow book, making it the second from the right."

Options:
(A) Joe finished third
(B) Mya finished third
(C) Eve finished third
(D) Amy finished third
(E) Ana finished third",(C),"The correct answer is (D) Amy finished third.   We can determine this using the given statements:  - Mya finished above Joe, so Joe must have finished fifth and Mya must have finished first or second.  - Eve finished below Joe, so Eve must have finished fourth or fifth.  - Ana finished below Amy, so Ana must have finished either fourth or fifth and Amy must have finished first, second, or third.  - Eve finished above Amy, so if Amy finished first, then Eve would have finished first or second, which is not consistent with her finishing below Joe. Therefore, Amy must have finished either second or third.  - Since Mya finished above Joe and Eve finished below Amy, the only way for all of the statements to be consistent is for Mya and Amy to finish first and second, in some order, and for Eve to finish third.

"The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: watermelons, oranges, loquats, plums, and kiwis. The plums are less expensive than the kiwis. The plums are more expensive than the watermelons.

(C) The robin is the third from the left
(D) The hummingbird is the third from the left
(E) The crow is the third from the left",(E),"The correct answer is (B) The raven is the third from the left.   According to the given statement, the robin is the leftmost, and then comes the raven. Since there are five birds, the hawk, the crow, and the hummingbird are left. The hawk is the second from the right, which means it is at the opposite end of the robin. This leaves the crow and the hummingbird in the center. However, the crow is already positioned as the third from the left in the statement, which means the hummingbird must be the fourth from the left. Therefore, the answer is (B) the raven is the third from the left."
