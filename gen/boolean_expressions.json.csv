not ( True ) and ( True ) is,False,"False.   The ""not"" operator negates the truth value of the expression it precedes. In this case, ""True"" is negated, so it becomes ""False"".   The ""and"" operator evaluates to ""True"" if both expressions on either side of it are true. However, in this case, one expression is ""False"" and the other is ""True"", so the overall result is ""False""."
True and not not ( not False ) is,True,"True.   The given expression can be simplified as follows:   not False = True   not True = False   not (not False) = not True = False   Finally,   True and not False = True and True = True"
not True or False or ( False ) is,False,False
False or not ( True ) and False is,False,False.
True or not False and True and False is,True,False.
False or not not not False and True is,True,"True.  The order of operations for Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) is NOT, AND, OR.   So, let's break it down:   - not not not False = not not True = not False = True  - True and True = True   Therefore, the final result is True."
not True and ( False or True ) is,False,"False.   The statement ""not True"" evaluates to False.   The statement ""False or True"" evaluates to True.   Thus, putting them together using the ""and"" operator, we get:   False and True   Which evaluates to False."
True and not False or ( True ) is,True,"True.   The expression is evaluated using the order of operations, which is parentheses, then not, then and, and finally or.   First, the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated, which is True.   Then, the not operator is evaluated on False which becomes True.   Finally, True or True is evaluated, which is True."
not True or ( False and True ) is,False,"True.   This is because the ""not"" operator negates the value of the expression that follows, and in this case, the expression in the parentheses evaluates to False, since False and True is False. Therefore, the entire expression is equivalent to ""not False"", which is True."
not True or ( True or False ) is,True,"True.  This is because of the order of operations in boolean algebra. According to the ""or"" operator logic, if any of the operands is True, then the entire expression evaluates to True. In this case, the expression inside the parentheses, ""True or False"", evaluates to True because one of the operands is True. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to True, regardless of the first operand."
False or ( False ) and not False is,False,"False.   Firstly, the expression inside the brackets evaluates to False. So, we have:  False or ( False ) and not False  Next, we evaluate the ""and not"" operator before the ""or"" operator.   False or False and not False  not False evaluates to True, so we have:  False or False and True  Finally, we evaluate the ""and"" operator first, then the ""or"" operator:  ( False or False ) and True  False or False is False, so we have:  False and True  Which evaluates to:  False"
not False or True and False and False is,True,"False  This is because of the order of operations in Boolean logic. ""not"" has the highest precedence, followed by ""and,"" and then ""or."" Therefore, the expression is evaluated as:  1. ""not False"" which is True 2. ""True or True"" which is True 3. ""True and False"" which is False 4. ""False and False"" which is False  So the final result is False."
not True or False or not not True is,True,"False.   This statement can be simplified using the order of operations in logic:   1. ""not not True"" evaluates to ""True"" (since double negatives cancel out) 2. ""not True"" evaluates to ""False""  3. ""False or False"" evaluates to ""False""   Therefore, the final result is ""False""."
True and True and False and not True is,False,"False.  Explanation: True and True evaluates to True False and not True evaluates to False Therefore, True and True and False and not True evaluates to False."
not not True and not True or True is,True,"True.   Let's break it down:  not not True simplifies to True.  not True simplifies to False.  True or True evaluates to True.  Therefore, not not True and not True or True is equivalent to True and False or True, which evaluates to True."
not not not ( True and False ) is,True,"True.   The expression `True and False` would evaluate to `False`, and then applying the negation operator `not` to it would result in the Boolean value `True`."
not not False and not not not False is,False,"True.   The expression ""not not False"" is equivalent to ""True"" because the ""not"" operator negates the value and ""not False"" is the negation of ""False"". Therefore, ""not not False"" evaluates to ""True"".   Similarly, ""not not not False"" is equivalent to ""False"" because it is the negation of ""not not False"" which is ""True"". Therefore, ""not not not False"" evaluates to ""False"".   So, the overall expression ""not not False and not not not False"" can be simplified to ""True and False"", which evaluates to ""False""."
( True and not True and False ) is,False,"False.   In this expression, the operator ""and"" connects the three values, which are evaluated from left to right.   - The first value is True, which means that the expression could potentially be true, and so we go onto the next value.   - The second value is ""not True"", which is False, so the entire expression cannot be true anymore, and we can stop evaluating it.   Therefore, the entire expression is False."
False and False and False or not False is,True,"True.  The expression evaluates as follows:  1. ""False and False"" evaluates to False. 2. ""False or not False"" evaluates to True, because ""not False"" is True, and the expression is connected by ""or"" and at least one operand is True. 3. Therefore, the final answer is True."
False or ( False and not False ) is,False,"False.   The expression ""False and not False"" would evaluate to False because ""not False"" would be True, but the presence of ""and"" means both sides of the expression must be True for the entire expression to be True. Since one side is False, the entire expression is False.   So, ""False or ( False and not False )"" would evaluate to False because ""False and not False"" is False according to the logic expressed above, and ""False or False"" is also False because in an ""or"" statement only one side needs to be True for the entire statement to be True."
True and False or ( not True ) is,False,"False.  Here's the breakdown of the steps:  1. True and False: This is evaluating the logical AND operation between True and False. The result is always False, because both values must be True for the AND operation to return True.  2. not True: This is negating the value of True using the logical NOT operator. The result is False.  3. True and False or not True: This is evaluating the logical OR operation between False (the result of True and False) and False (the result of not True). Since at least one operand must be True for the OR operation to return True, the result is False."
not not ( True ) and not False is,True,"True.   The expression ""not False"" evaluates to True, and then the outer expression ""not (True)"" evaluates to False. However, the additional ""not"" operator in front of the expression flips the result again to True."
not False or ( True ) and True is,True,"True.   The order of operations is to first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which in this case is just ""True"". Then, the ""not"" operator negates the False value, making it True. Finally, the ""and"" operator connects the values, but because both are True, the overall expression evaluates to True."
not ( True ) or False or True is,True,"True.   The expression evaluates to True because the ""not (True)"" part is equivalent to ""False"" and the remaining ""False or True"" part evaluates to True because at least one of the operands is True in an OR operation."
( True and not not not True ) is,False,"True.   The statement ""not not not True"" cancels out any negations and simply results in ""True"". Therefore, the statement ""(True and True)"" is True."
( False or not False or False ) is,True,"False.   The expression evaluates to False because the logical OR operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True, otherwise it returns False. In this case, all the operands are False, so the expression returns False."
False and False or True and not False is,True,"True.  Here is the evaluation:  False and False: False  True and not False: True  False or True: True  Therefore, the final result is True."
not not False or not False or True is,True,"True.   This is because of the order of operations in Python. First, the two ""not"" operators are applied to ""False"" which results in ""True"".   Then, the ""or"" operator evaluates the expression from left to right, and if any of the operands is True, the whole expression evaluates to True. So, since the first two operands are both ""True"", the expression evaluates to True."
True and not True or False or True is,True,"True  The evaluation of the expression is as follows: - ""True and not True"" evaluates to False - ""False or False or True"" evaluates to True - Therefore, the overall expression is True."
not False or True and False or False is,True,"False.   In this expression, the ""not"" operator has the highest precedence, so ""not False"" gets evaluated first, resulting in True. Then, ""True or True and False or False"" is evaluated from left to right, taking into account the order of precedence of the operators. The ""and"" operator has a higher precedence than ""or"", so ""True and False"" is evaluated first, resulting in False. Then, ""True or False or False"" is evaluated, which yields True. Therefore, the overall expression evaluates to False."
False and ( not False ) or False is,False,"True.  This is because of the order of operations in logical expressions. The not operator has higher precedence than and and or, so not False is evaluated first, resulting in True. Then, False and True evaluates to False, and False or False evaluates to False as well. Therefore, the final result is False or False, which is False."
not not not not ( not False ) is,True,"True.   The outermost ""not"" will invert the value of whatever comes after it. In this case, it's ""not False"", which evaluates to ""True"". So the outermost ""not"" inverts ""True"" to ""False"". But then there are three more ""nots"" in a row, which will invert the value twice more, resulting in ""True"".   So the final result is ""True""."
( True ) and True or not True is,True,"True.   This is because the statement ""True and True"" is true as both conditions are true, and the statement ""True or not True"" is also true because ""not True"" (which is False) is being combined with ""True"" using the ""or"" operator. Therefore, the final result is True."
not True or False and False and False is,False,"False.   The expression ""True or False"" is evaluated as True, and ""False and False"" is evaluated as False. Therefore, ""True or False and False and False"" is equivalent to ""True or (False and False) "", which simplifies to ""True or False"" and ultimately evaluates to True."
not not not not not not not False is,True,True.
not True or not False and not False is,True,"True.   This is because the order of operations in boolean logic is:   1. not  2. and  3. or   Therefore, the evaluation of `not True or not False and not False` would be:  1. `not True` evaluates to `False` 2. `not False` evaluates to `True` 3. `False or True and True` evaluates to `True`  Therefore, the final result is `True`."
False or True or False and not False is,True,"True.   The expression ""False or True"" is evaluated to True because at least one of the operands is True.  Then, the expression ""False and not False"" is evaluated to False because one operand is True and the other is False, but the ""and"" logical operator requires both operands to be True in order to return True.  Finally, the expression ""True or False"" is evaluated to True because at least one of the operands is True.   Therefore, the entire expression ""False or True or False and not False"" is equivalent to ""True or False"", which evaluates to True."
not ( True or True ) and False is,False,"False.   The expression inside the parentheses (True or True) evaluates to True because at least one of the conditions is True. Then, the negation operator ""not"" flips the value to False. Finally, ""and False"" returns False because one of the conditions is False."
not not not not True and not True is,False,"True.   The expression ""not not not not True"" evaluates to True because four negations of True cancel each other out, resulting in the original value of True.  The expression ""not True"" evaluates to False because the ""not"" operator reverses the truth value of True.  Therefore, ""not not not not True and not True"" is equivalent to ""True and False"", which evaluates to False because both expressions need to be true in order for the ""and"" operator to return True."
( False ) or False and not True is,False,"False.   To break it down:   - False or anything is simply ""anything"", since the Boolean operator ""or"" evaluates to True if at least one of the operands is True.  - So False or not True would be equivalent to False or False, which would still be False."
( False and True or not False ) is,True,"True.   The order of operations is to evaluate the ""not"" operator first, so ""not False"" is True. Then, evaluate ""False and True"", which is False. Finally, evaluate ""True or False"", which is True."
not not not ( False and True ) is,True,"False. The expression `not not not (False and True)` can be simplified as follows:  1. `False and True` evaluates to `False`.  2. `not (False)` evaluates to `True`. 3. `not (True)` evaluates to `False`. 4. `not (False)` evaluates to `True`.  Therefore, the final result is `True`."
not not True and not False or True is,True,"True  The order of precedence for this expression is:  1. ""not"" operators 2. ""and"" operators 3. ""or"" operators  So, the expression simplifies like this:  1. not not True -> True 2. not False -> True 3. True or True -> True  Therefore, the final result is True."
not False or True and not not True is,True,"True.  The order of operations is:  1. Evaluate ""not False"", which is True. 2. Evaluate ""not True"", which is False. 3. Evaluate ""True and False"", which is False. 4. Finally, evaluate ""True or False"", which is True.  Therefore, the final result is True."
True or True or not False or False is,True,"True.   ""True or True"" evaluates to True.   ""Not False"" evaluates to True.   So, ""True or True or not False or False"" can be written as ""True or True or True or False"", which evaluates to True."
( not False and False and False ) is,False,"False.   This is because the ""and"" logical operator requires that all the conditions being compared are True in order to return True itself. If any of the conditions is False, the entire expression will return False.   In this case, the first condition ""not False"" is True (because ""not False"" means ""True""), but the following two conditions ""False and False"" are both False. Therefore, the entire expression returns False."
( ( not True ) or True ) is,True,"True.   This is because of the rules of boolean algebra. The ""not True"" part evaluates to False, and then you have:  (False or True)  In an 'or' statement, if either of the operands is True, then the overall statement is True. So the result is True."
not not ( not False or True ) is,True,"False.  Here's the explanation:  1. First, let's evaluate the expression inside the innermost pair of parentheses.       not False evaluates to True, since ""not"" flips the truth value of False.      True or True evaluates to True, since ""or"" returns True if at least one of the operands is True.  2. Next, we evaluate the expression inside the middle pair of parentheses.      not (True) evaluates to False, since ""not"" flips the truth value of True.  3. Finally, we evaluate the expression inside the outermost pair of parentheses.      not False evaluates to True, since ""not"" flips the truth value of False.  Therefore, the final result is False, since we have a double negative (not not)."
not True or False or ( True ) is,True,"False.   The expression `not True` evaluates to `False`, and `True` in parentheses remain `True`. The `or` operator checks if any of the operands evaluate to `True`, which is the case in this expression."
False or ( not False ) and True is,True,"True  The expression evaluates in the following manner:   - The sub-expression `not False` evaluates to `True`, because `not False` means `not 0`, which equals `1`. - The sub-expression `False or True` also evaluates to `True`, because `or` will return the first value that evaluates to `True` and `True` does. - Finally, the entire expression evaluates to `True`."
not False or False or ( False ) is,True,"True.   The expression is evaluated from left to right and uses the logical operator ""or"" which returns True if at least one of the operands is True.   In this case, the first operand ""not False"" is True because the ""not"" operator inverts the boolean value of False. Therefore, the expression returns True without having to evaluate the remaining operands."
not not False or False and not True is,False,"True.   This is because of the order of operations which is usually abbreviated as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).  In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step which is multiplication and division. However, there are none of those either, so we move on to addition and subtraction. Still none of those, so we move on to the next step which is AND ('and') and OR ('or').   Since 'not' has higher precedence than 'and' and 'or', we first evaluate the two 'not' operators. 'not False' evaluates to True and 'not True' evaluates to False. So now we have 'not True or False and False'.   Next step is to evaluate the 'and' operator, but we have to evaluate the 'or' operator first. The 'or' operator returns True if at least one of its operands is True, and False otherwise. Here, the left operand 'not True' evaluated to False, and since False or False is False, the expression simplifies to 'False and False'.  Finally, the 'and' operator returns True if both of its operands are True, and False otherwise. Since both operands here are False, the expression evaluates to False."
True or ( ( not True ) ) is,True,False.
not False and not False and not False is,True,"True.   This is because the logical operator ""not"" inverts the truth value of a statement. Since ""False"" is already a boolean value of ""False"", applying ""not"" to ""False"" results in ""True"". Therefore, when ""not"" is applied to ""False"" three times in a row, the end result is still ""True""."
( False ) and not False and True is,False,"False.   The order of operations is: 1. ""not"" is evaluated first 2. ""and"" is evaluated next 3. ""or"" is evaluated last   So the expression ""False and not False and True"" would be evaluated in this order:   1. not False = True  2. False and True = False   Therefore, the overall result is False."
( True ) and False or not False is,True,"True.   This is because the order of operations for logical operators is:  1. Not 2. And 3. Or  So in this expression, ""not False"" is evaluated first, which is True. Then, ""False or True"" is evaluated, which is True."
( not False and ( True ) ) is,True,"True.   The expression ""not False"" evaluates to True. And since ""(True)"" is also True, the whole expression evaluates to True."
False or not ( False ) or True is,True,True.
True and not False and not not True is,True,"True.   In this logical expression, there are three parts: True, not False, and not not True.   True is always true, so we can disregard it.  not False is true, because the negation of False is True. not not True is also true, because the double negation of True results in True.  Therefore, the entire expression is True."
not True and True and True or False is,False,"True.   The expression evaluates the `and` operators first, then the `or` operator. Since all of the `and` statements evaluate to `True`, and at least one `or` statement is `True`, the overall expression is evaluated to `True`."
not not ( False and not True ) is,False,"True, because ""not True"" is False, and ""False and False"" is also False, so ""not (False and False)"" is True."
True or not ( ( False ) ) is,True,False.
False or not True or False or False is,False,"False.   When evaluating expressions in Python, the ""or"" operator returns the first true value it encounters or the last value if both are false. Therefore, in this expression, it will return the first ""False"" value encountered, which is False."
False or not not True or not False is,True,True.
not ( True or True or False ) is,False,"False.   The expression `True or True or False` evaluates to `True` because at least one of the conditions is true.   The `not` operator negates the value of the expression, so `not ( True or True or False )` will be `False`."
False or not not not not not False is,True,"True.   The double negative of ""not not"" cancels out, so ""not not not not not"" is the same as ""not"" five times, which ultimately makes the statement True. Therefore, False or not not not not not False is True."
not ( False ) or not not True is,True,True  The order of operations for this expression is as follows:  1. not False => True 2. not not True => True 3. True or True => True
True and not False or False and False is,True,"True.  The order of operation for this expression is:  1. Evaluate ""True and not False"" which results in True. 2. Evaluate ""False and False"" which results in False. 3. Evaluate ""True or False"" which results in True.  Therefore, the final output is True."
True or ( not ( True ) ) is,True,"False.   The inner part of the expression ""not ( True )"" evaluates to False, so the expression becomes ""True or False"", which evaluates to True in this case."
( False or True and not True ) is,False,"False.  The expression evaluates from left to right, first evaluating `True and not True`. Since `True and not True` evaluates to `False`, the expression simplifies to `False or False`, which evaluates to `False`."
False or not True and True or True is,True,"True.   The order of operations for boolean expressions is: 1. Not 2. And 3. Or  So, not True evaluates to False, then True and True evaluates to True, and finally True or True evaluates to True. Therefore, the overall expression is True."
not not not not not not not True is,False,False.
( not False ) and False or True is,True,"True.  This is because of the order of operations in Boolean logic.   The expression evaluates the parentheses first, resulting in ""not False"" which is equal to True.   Then it evaluates ""True and False"", which is False.   Finally, it evaluates ""False or True"", which is True.  Therefore, the overall result is True."
False and False or not ( True ) is,False,"True.  This statement is evaluated based on the order of operations in logical expressions: - First, the NOT operator is evaluated, so ""not True"" becomes False. - Then, the AND operator is evaluated from left to right. Both operands are False, so the result of the AND operation is False. - Finally, the OR operator is evaluated from left to right. The only operand left is False, and the OR operation with False and anything else always results in the value of the other operand. Therefore, the final result is True."
( not False or True ) and True is,True,"True.   Here's how to break it down:  1. Assess the expression inside the brackets first: not False evaluates to True, so we have (True or True) and True 2. True or True is True (because at least one of the operands is true) 3. Now we have True and True, which is simply True 4. Therefore, the whole expression evaluates to True"
not ( False ) and ( False ) is,False,"False.   This is because the logical operator ""not"" will invert the value of the first operand, which is False. This will make it True. However, since the second operand is also False, the overall expression will evaluate to False.   Here's the evaluation step by step:  1. not (False) evaluates to True.  2. (True) and (False) evaluates to False."
False or True and not not not False is,True,"True.   False = False,  not False = True,  not not False = False,  not not not False = True   So, False or True and not not not False simplifies to True or True, which is always True."
( True ) and True and not True is,False,False.
( not True ) and True and False is,False,"False.   In this statement, the first part ""not True"" is False, and ""True and False"" is also False. Therefore, False and False is False."
( not not True and not False ) is,True,"not not True is True and not False is True, so the expression (not not True and not False) evaluates to True."
True and ( False ) or not False is,True,"True.   This is because of the order of operations for Boolean logic.   First, the ""not False"" is evaluated, which is True.   Then, the ""True and False"" is evaluated, which is False.   Finally, the ""False or True"" is evaluated, which is True."
not not not False or False and False is,True,"True.  This is because the order of operations for Boolean operators is not, and, or.   So the expression is evaluated as:   1. not not not False -> not not True -> not False -> True 2. False or False -> False  Then the overall expression becomes:   True or False -> True"
not not not False and True or False is,True,"True  This is because of the order of operations in Python. The ""not"" operator has the highest precedence, followed by ""and"", and finally ""or"".   So, first, ""not False"" evaluates to ""True"". Then, ""not True"" evaluates to ""False"".

True or ( True or not False ) is,True,"True.  In the expression ""True or (True or not False)"", the inner parentheses are evaluated first. ""not False"" is True, so the expression becomes ""True or True"". Since at least one of these values is True, the result is True."
not False or ( ( False ) ) is,True,"True.   This is because the ""not False"" expression evaluates to True, and the extra parentheses surrounding the False evaluate to False (since there is no operator or logical expression involved).   So the overall expression is True or False, which evaluates to True."
not not ( False and not False ) is,False,False.  Let's simplify the expression step by step:  1. not False = True 2. False and True = False 3. not False and False = False
not not not not True or not True is,True,"True.  The logical expression `not not not not True or not True` evaluates as follows:  1. `not True` is `False`. 2. `not False` is `True`. 3. `not True` is `False`. 4. `not False` is `True`.  Therefore, we have `not not not not True` equal to `not not not False` equal to `not not True` equal to `not False` equal to `True`.   Next, we have `not True`, which is `False`.  Finally, we have `True or False`, which evaluates to `True`.   So the entire expression `not not not not True or not True` is equal to `True`."

False or not False or True and True is,True,"True.   The order of operations in this expression is first to evaluate 'True and True'. Since both 'True' values evaluate to True, the expression becomes 'False or not False or True', which evaluates to True because at least one of the conditions is True."
not False and False and False or False is,False,"False  The expression evaluates from left to right, so it first checks ""not False"", which is ""True"". Then it checks ""True and False"", which is ""False"". It then checks ""False and False"", which is ""False"". Finally, it evaluates ""False or False"" which is ""False""."
( False ) or not False or True is,True,True
( not False ) or ( True ) is,True,"True. This is because the ""or"" operation will return True if at least one of the expressions on either side of it evaluates to True. In this case, the expression ""not False"" evaluates to True, and ""True"" is already True, so the whole expression is True."
not not ( False or not True ) is,False,"True.   The expression can be simplified as follows:  1. The expression ""not True"" evaluates to False. 2. The expression ""False or False"" evaluates to False. 3. The expression ""not False"" evaluates to True.

False or not False or False or False is,True,False.
False or not False and ( False ) is,False,"False.   This is because of the order of operations in logical expressions.

False or not False or not not True is,True,"True.   The order of operations for logical operators is as follows: 1. not 2. and 3. or  Using this order, we can evaluate the expression: 1. not not True = not False = True 2. False or True = True  Therefore, the final result is True."
( True or not False ) or False is,True,True
False or not ( True ) and True is,False,True.
not False and not True and not False is,False,"False.   The expressions ""not False"" and ""not True"" evaluate to True and False respectively, and ""not False and not True"" evaluates to False. Finally, ""False and anything"" always evaluates to False."
False and ( True and not False ) is,False,"True.   The expression can be broken down as follows: - False and <anything> is always False - True and not False is True (since not False is True, and anything and True is equal to that anything)  Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to True."
not False or ( False ) or True is,True,True
False and not ( False and True ) is,False,True.   - False and True is False.  - not(False and True) is not(False) which is True.
( True or not not not False ) is,True,True.
False and ( False or not False ) is,False,"False.  The first expression ""False"" evaluates to False.   In the second expression inside the parentheses, we have (False or not False). ""not False"" is True, so this expression evaluates to (False or True). Since one of the operands is True, the ""or"" operator returns True.   Finally, we have False and True, which evaluates to False, since both operands need to be True for the ""and"" operator to return True."
False or not True or True and False is,False,"False.   In Python (and most programming languages), the order of operations for Boolean operators is NOT, AND, OR.   So, starting from the left:  - ""not True"" is False - ""True and False"" is False - ""False or False"" is False  Therefore, the entire statement evaluates to False."
True and not True or True and True is,True,"True.   This expression follows the order of operations or precedence of logical operators: first, the NOT operator is evaluated. In this case, it turns the ""not True"" into ""False,"" which leaves us with:  False or True and True  Next, the AND operator is evaluated first because it has a higher precedence than OR. Both the expressions ""True and True"" are true, which means the whole expression evaluates to:  False or True  Finally, the OR operator is evaluated. Because one of the expressions is true, it makes the whole expression True."
( not False or ( True ) ) is,True,"True.   This is because the expression is evaluated using order of operations.   First, the expression within the parentheses is evaluated, and (True) simplifies to just True.   Then, the not operator is applied to False, which turns it into True.   Finally, the or operator checks if either expression is True, and since at least one of the expressions is True, the entire expression evaluates to True."
( ( not ( True ) ) ) is,False,"False.   The innermost expression `( True )` is evaluated as True. The `not` operator negates this value, resulting in False. The additional set of parentheses have no effect on the value. Therefore, the final result is False."
False and False and not ( False ) is,False,"False, because: - False and False is False - not False is True - False and True is False"
not True and not True and not True is,False,"True.   This is because the logical operator ""not"" inverts the truth value of whatever comes after it.   If we start with ""True"", then ""not True"" would be ""False"". Taking this result and applying ""not"" again gives us ""not False"", which is ""True"". Repeating this process one more time gives us ""not True"", which is ""False"".   Therefore, the final result of ""not True and not True and not True"" is ""False""."
not ( True or False ) or True is,True,equivalent to:  False or True  which results in:  True
False or ( True ) or not True is,True,"True.   The statement ""False or ( True )"" evaluates to True because one of the conditions (True) is true. The statement ""not True"" evaluates to False. Therefore, the final evaluation is True."
False or False and False or not True is,False,"False.   When evaluating this expression, we first look at the ""not True"" part. ""not True"" is evaluated as False.   False or False is False, because in an ""or"" operation, if either side is True, the whole expression is True.   Finally, False and False is also False, because in an ""and"" operation, both sides must be True for the whole expression to be True.   Therefore, the whole expression False or False and False or not True simplifies to False."
True or False or not True or False is,True,not a clear statement/question. It does not provide sufficient information or context to determine whether it is true or false. Could you please provide more details or rephrase your query?
not True and ( True and True ) is,False,"True.   The first part of the statement ""not True"" evaluates to False.   The second part of the statement ""(True and True)"" evaluates to True, since both True values are being combined with the ""and"" operator.   Therefore, when you combine the first part of the statement with the second part using the ""and"" operator, you get:   False and True   Which ultimately evaluates to False."
not True and True or True and False is,False,"True.   This is because of the order of operations. First, the AND operators (True and True, True and False) are evaluated from left to right. True and True is True and True and False is False. Then, the OR operator is evaluated. True OR False is True."
not False or ( True or True ) is,True,"True.  Here's why:  Starting from the inside, the parentheses evaluate as True or True, which is True.  Then we have not False, which is also True.  Finally, we have True or True, which is True.  So the entire expression evaluates to True."
not ( False or ( False ) ) is,True,"True.   The statement `not (False or (False))` can be simplified as follows:  1. `(False)` inside the parenthesis evaluates to `False`.  2. `False or False` evaluates to `False`.  3. `not False` evaluates to `True`.  Therefore, the overall statement returns `True`."
not ( True or True ) and True is,False,"False.   The logical operator `not` negates the entire expression that follows it. So `not (True or True)` evaluates to `not True` which is `False`.   Then, the remaining expression is `False and True`, which evaluates to `False`, since both operands must be True for the expression to be True."
False or not False or True or True is,True,True.
False or False and not not not False is,False,True.
not ( True or False or True ) is,False,"False.   To evaluate this expression, we first evaluate the innermost expressions in the parentheses:   ""True or False"" is evaluated as True because at least one of the operands is True,   so we have ""not (True or True)"", which is equivalent to ""not True"",   and ""not True"" evaluates to False."
( False ) or not True and False is,False,"True. ""Not True"" evaluates to False and ""False and False"" evaluates to False. Therefore, ""True or False"" evaluates to True."
True and True and not not not False is,True,True.   Explanation:   - True and True = True  - not False = True  - not True = False  - not False (again) = True   So:   - True and True and not not not False  - = True and True and not not True  - = True and True and True  - = True
( True ) or True and not True is,True,False.
False and False and not True and False is,False,"False.   When evaluating this expression, we can break it down:  - False and False = False - not True = False - False and False and False = False.   So the entire expression evaluates to False."
( True ) and not True or True is,True,"True.   When evaluating boolean expressions, ""not"" has a higher precedence than ""or"", so ""not True"" is evaluated first, resulting in False. Then, the remaining expression ""False or True"" is evaluated, resulting in True."
not not not True and False and False is,False,False.
False and False and not not not True is,False,"False.   The expression can be broken down as follows:   1. False and False is False  2. not False is True  3. not True is False  4. not False is True   Therefore, False and False and not not not True is equivalent to False and False and True, which is False."
False and False or False or not True is,False,"True.   Here's the evaluation process:  False and False = False  False or False = False  False or not True = False  Therefore, the overall expression becomes False or False, which evaluates to False."
False or ( not ( False ) ) is,True,True.
not True and True and not not False is,False,True  The expression can be simplified as follows:  not True = False  not not False = False  True and True and False = False  not False = True  Final result: True
( False ) and ( not False ) is,False,"(True) as 'not False' means the opposite of False, which is True. Therefore, the entire statement is comparing True and True, which results in True."
( not True ) and True or True is,True,"True.   This is because of the order of operations.   First, the bracketed expression (not True) is evaluated, which results in False.   Then, False and True is evaluated, which results in False (because both values must be True for the AND operator to return True)  Finally, the OR operator is evaluated with False and True, which results in True (because at least one value is True for the OR operator to return True)."
False and True and ( not False ) is,False,"True.   Here's the explanation:  - False and True evaluates to False because both expressions need to be True for the overall expression to be True. - not False is True because it negates the False, making it True. - False and True and (not False) evaluates to False and True and True. - The AND operator evaluates left to right, so False and True is evaluated first, resulting in False. - False and True and True is evaluated next, which results in False.  Therefore, the overall expression is False."
( ( True ) ) or not False is,True,"True.   The expressions inside the parenthesis evaluate to True, and the expression ""not False"" also evaluates to True. When you use the ""or"" operator between two True values, the result is also True."
not True and False or False or True is,True,"True.   This expression is evaluated using operator precedence and boolean logic.   The `not` operator is evaluated first, so `not True` returns `False`.   Then, the `and` operator is evaluated from left to right. Since `False and False` would be false, the next value to be evaluated is `False or False`, which returns `False`.   Finally, the last value to be evaluated is `False or True`, which returns `True`.   Therefore, the overall value of the expression is `True`."
True and not True and True and True is,False,"False.   The statement ""True and not True"" evaluates to False because ""not True"" means False.   So, False and True and True and True would be False."
( True or True or not False ) is,True,True.
True or not False and True or True is,True,"True.   The order of operations is to first evaluate not False which is True. Then you evaluate True or True, which is also True. Therefore the overall expression is True."
( not ( False ) or False ) is,True,"True.   The expression evaluates as follows:  - ""not False"" is True - ""True or False"" is True  So the entire expression is True."
True and not ( True or False ) is,False,"False.   The expression True or False will evaluate to True because at least one of the operands is True.   But when you apply the logical NOT operator to this result, it will invert the logical value. So, the final result will be False.   Therefore,   ``` True and not (True or False) ```  evaluates to   ``` True and not True ```  which is False."
not ( False and True ) and True is,True,"True.  The expression evaluates as follows:  - ""not (False and True)"" first evaluates the ""False and True"" sub-expression, which is False because one of the operands is False and the other is True. - The ""not"" operator then negates the result, giving True. - Finally, the second operand ""True"" is evaluated, which always results in True.  Therefore, the whole expression evaluates to True."
not ( True and True ) or False is,False,False.   This expression can be evaluated as:  - not ( True and True ) => not True => False   - False or False => False
False or not True and not not False is,False,"True.   The order of operations is as follows:   1. ""not"" operator is evaluated first. ""not False"" becomes ""True"". 2. ""not"" operator is evaluated again. ""not not False"" becomes ""False"". 3. ""and"" operator is evaluated. ""True and False"" becomes ""False"". 4. The final result is ""False""."
not True and False or False and False is,False,"False.   The expression ""True and False"" evaluates to False because for the ""and"" operator to return True, both operands must be True. Similarly, ""False and False"" also evaluates to False.   Therefore, when we take the ""or"" operator between False and False, the result is False."
not True or True and False or False is,False,"False.  The evaluation steps are:  1. not True = False 2. True and False = False 3. False or False = False  Therefore, the final result of the expression is False."
( not ( False ) and False ) is,False,"False.   Explanation: The expression inside the parentheses evaluates to False, since False is not True. And since the outermost operator is ""and"" which requires both expressions to be True in order to yield True, the entire expression evaluates to False."
False or ( True and not True ) is,False,"False.   The expression within the parentheses evaluates to False since True and not True is equivalent to True and False, and the result of an ""and"" operation with a False value is always False. Therefore, False becomes the final result of the entire expression."
not False and not True or not True is,False,"False.  The order of operations here is important. The 'not' operator has a higher precedence than 'and' and 'or'. Therefore, the expression is evaluated as:  1. not False is True 2. not True is False 3. 'not False and not True' evaluates to False because both values are negated 4. False 'or' False is False because neither value is True  So, the final result is False."
( False or not not not False ) is,True,"True.   Here's how it breaks down:   - ""not False"" evaluates to True - ""not not False"" evaluates to False - ""False or False"" evaluates to False  - ""not False or not not not False"" evaluates to True, since ""not not not False"" is equivalent to ""not False"", which is True."
( not False ) or True and False is,True,True.  This is because the order of operations for boolean operators is:  1. not 2. and 3. or  So the expression is evaluated as:  1. not False -> True 2. True and False -> False 3. True or False -> True   Therefore the overall result is True.
( not not True ) or not False is,True,"True.   Let's break it down:  1. ""not True"" is False. 2. ""not False"" is True. 3. ""not True"" or ""True"" is True (since one of the operands is True, the result will be True).  So, (not not True) or not False simplifies to True or True which is True."
True or not ( ( True ) ) is,True,True.
( False ) and False or not False is,True,"True.   First, we evaluate False and False as both are operands of the `and` operator. The result of `and` operator is only True if both operands are True, else it is False. Since both operands are False, the result of `False and False` is False.  Then, we evaluate the `not False` expression. `not False` is equivalent to `True`, because it negates the value of False (which is `not` True).  Finally, we evaluate the `or` operator with the results of the previous expressions. The `or` operator returns True if at least one operand is True, otherwise it returns False. In this case, one operand is True and the other is False, so the result is `True`."
not False and True or ( True ) is,True,"True.  This is because ""not False"" is True, ""True or (True)"" is also True, and True takes precedence over ""and"" and ""or"" operators in Python, so the final result is True.   Here's the evaluation process:   - not False -> True - True or (True) -> True  Therefore, the final result is True."
True or not not ( not False ) is,True,"True.   - First, evaluate the innermost ""not False"" to get ""True"". - Then, negate that again with ""not"" to get the final result of ""False"".   But since there are two ""not"" operators present, we need to apply the order of operations, which tells us to first apply the innermost ""not"" before the outer one."
False and not True and False and True is,False,"False.   The expression ""False and not True and False and True"" will be evaluated as follows: 1. ""False and not True"" results in False because ""not True"" is False. 2. ""False and False"" results in False. 3. ""False and True"" results in False.   So, the final result is False."
not not True and True and not True is,False,False.   Here's how the evaluation goes:  1. not not True is True 2. True and not True is False 3. False and True is False
not False or not ( not False ) is,True,"True  Here's the evaluation of the expression:  not False --> True  not (not False) --> not True --> False  Therefore, not False or not (not False) is equivalent to True or False which is True."
not not ( True ) or not True is,True,True.
( True and not True and True ) is,False,False.   The expression (True and not True and True) evaluates as follows:  1. True and not True evaluates to False (since not True is False) 2. False and True evaluates to False (since the first operand is False)  So the final result is False.
True or False or not True or True is,True,True.
not True or True and False and False is,False,"False.  The order of operations for logical operators is as follows: NOT, AND, OR.   Therefore, starting from the left:   - NOT True evaluates to False - True OR False evaluates to True - True AND False evaluates to False - False AND False evaluates to False  So, the final result is False."
True and not not not not not True is,False,False.
not True and ( False ) and False is,False,"False.   The expression `not True` evaluates to `False`, and the expression `False and False` also evaluates to `False`. The parentheses around `False` in `( False )` are unnecessary and do not affect the outcome of the expression."
False and False or not True and False is,False,"False.  The order of precedence for boolean operators is ""not"" first, ""and"" second, and ""or"" third.   So, in this case, the evaluation would be:  False and False = False  not True = False  False and False = False   Therefore, the final result is False."
True or False and not True and False is,True,"False.  Here's how the evaluation goes:  - ""True or False"" first evaluates to True, because at least one of the operands (""True"") is true. - Then, ""not True"" is False, because the ""not"" operator negates the value of its operand. - Finally, ""False and False"" is False, because both operands are false.  So, the whole expression is false."
not ( False or False or True ) is,False,"False.   The expression ""not ( False or False or True )"" is evaluating the logical OR operation between three Boolean values: False, False, and True.   False OR False OR True = True  The ""not"" operator negates the result, so:  not True = False"
not False or True or True and False is,True,"True.   This is because of the order of precedence for logical operators. In this expression, ""not"" has the highest precedence, so ""not False"" is evaluated first, which results in True.   Next, ""or"" is evaluated left to right. So, the expression becomes True or True and False.   Since ""and"" has higher precedence than ""or"", True and False is evaluated first. This expression results in False.   Finally, with False or True, ""or"" is evaluated left to right and the expression results in True."
not False and False or False or False is,False,False.  The order of operations for this expression is:   1. not False -> True 2. True and False -> False 3. False or False -> False 4. Final result: False
( not True ) and ( False ) is,False,"False.    `(not True)` is `False` because `not` negates whatever is after it, and `True` is negated to become `False`.    `(False)` is just `False`, as it is a boolean value in parentheses.    So, the overall expression is `False and False`, which evaluates to `False`."
True and not not False and not False is,False,"True.   Here's an explanation:   - ""not False"" returns True  - ""not not False"" returns the original value, which is True  - ""True and True"" returns True, because both values are True"
not ( not not False ) and True is,True,"True.  Let's break it down: - ""not False"" is True - ""not not False"" is False (because ""not False"" is True, and ""not True"" is False) - ""not not not False"" is True (because ""not not False"" is True) - Finally, we have ""not (not not False)"" which is True (because ""not not not False"" is True) - Combining this with ""True and True"", we get the final result of True."
not ( not False ) and not False is,False,True.
False or True and not False or True is,True,"True.   In the Boolean expression ""False or True"", the ""or"" operator results in True because at least one of the operands is True.   Then, the ""not"" operator negates the False value and turns it into True.   Finally, the ""or"" operator again evaluates to True because one of the operands is True.   So, the overall expression is True."
( not not not True and True ) is,False,"False.   The expression can be simplified as follows: - ""not True"" is False - ""not not True"" is True - ""True and True"" is True  So, the final result is True. However, you have a ""not"" in front of the entire expression, which negates the result, making it False."
False and not ( True ) or True is,True,"True.  The order of operations for this expression is:  1. Evaluate the innermost grouping: True. 2. Evaluate the negation of True: False. 3. Evaluate the conjunction of False and not True, which is False. 4. Evaluate the disjunction of False and True, which is True."
( not True and False or True ) is,True,"True.  This is because the ""not"" operator has the highest precedence, followed by ""and"" and then ""or"". So first ""not True"" evaluates to False, then ""False and False"" evaluates to False, and finally ""False or True"" evaluates to True."
not ( not not True ) or False is,False,"True.  The expression ""not not True"" evaluates to True, since it's the double negative of True. Therefore ""not (not not True)"" is also True.  The expression ""True or False"" evaluates to True, since at least one of the operands is True. Therefore the whole expression is True."
( not False ) or ( False ) is,True,"True.   This is because the first part of the expression, ""not False"", evaluates to True. The ""or"" operator only requires one part of the expression to be true for the entire expression to be true, so the entire expression is true."
not not not False and True and False is,False,"False.   Here's the explanation:   The expression `not not not False and True and False` is evaluated based on the order of operations in Python, which is as follows:   1. The `not` operator has the highest precedence, so the innermost `not False` part is evaluated first, which gives `True`.  2. The next innermost `not True` part is evaluated, which gives `False`.  3. The next higher precedence operator is `and`, which connects the result of the two `not` operations. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of the `and` operation is also `False`.  4. Finally, the outermost `and` operator is evaluated with the last operand `False`, which gives the overall result of `False`."
True or not True or not not True is,True,True.
not False or not not False and False is,True,"True.   This is because the 'not' operator has a higher precedence than 'or' and 'and' operators. So, the expression is evaluated as follows:  1) not False -> True 2) not not False -> not True -> False 3) False and False -> False 4) True or False -> True"
not False and ( False or False ) is,False,"False.   Here's the evaluation step by step:  1. not False = True (negation of False is True) 2. False or False = False (logical OR of two False values is False) 3. True and False = False (logical AND of True and False is False)  Therefore, the final result is False."
False and True or ( not False ) is,True,"True.   not False evaluates to True.   So, the expression becomes True or True, which will result in True."
False and not False and ( False ) is,False,"False.   In Python, the `and` operator evaluates to `True` only if both of its operands are `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `False`.   In the given expression, the first operand is `False`, so the `and` operator directly evaluates to `False` and does not need to evaluate the second operand, which is also `False`."
not ( ( False and True ) ) is,True,"True.   The expression inside the innermost parentheses is `False and True`, which evaluates to `False`. Then, the logical NOT operator (`not`) is applied to this `False` value, which results in `True`."
False or ( not False ) and False is,False,"False.   According to order of operations, the negation (not) operator is evaluated first, so (not False) becomes True. Then, the conjunction (and) operator is evaluated next.   True and False results in False, so the overall expression evaluates to False."
False and not False or False and True is,False,False.  The expression can be evaluated as:  False and not False or False and True  = False and True or False  = False or False  = False
not False and not not True and True is,True,"True.   This is because:  - ""not False"" evaluates to True - ""not not True"" also evaluates to True - ""True is True"" evaluates to True because the two values on either side of ""is"" are identical."
True and True or False and not True is,True,"False.  To solve this expression, we can first evaluate the AND expression ""True and not True."" This evaluates to ""False"" because one value is True and the other is False.  Next, we can evaluate the OR expression ""True and False."" This also evaluates to ""False"" because one value is True and the other is False.  Therefore, ""False"" is the final result of the expression ""True and True or False and not True."""
not True or False and True or False is,False,"True.   The order of operations for this equation would be to evaluate ""not True"" first, which would result in False. Then, we would evaluate ""False or False"" which again gives us False. Finally, we would evaluate ""True or False"" which gives us True. Therefore, the overall result would be True."
True or False or not True and True is,True,"True.   ""Not True and True"" would evaluate to False and ""True or False"" would evaluate to True. Therefore, the overall statement would be ""True"" as it is ""True or False""."
False or False or not True or False is,False,True.
False or False or True and not False is,True,"True.   This is because the expressions are evaluated in the following order:  1. `False or False`, which evaluates to False 2. `True and not False`, which evaluates to True 3. The final expression is composed of the results of the previous two expressions, so it evaluates to True."
( not ( True or False ) ) is,False,"False.   The expression `not (True or False)` can be evaluated as follows:  1. `True or False` evaluates to `True`, since at least one of the operands is `True`. 2. `not True` evaluates to `False`, since it negates the value of `True`.  Therefore, the entire expression is `False`."
not False and False or True and True is,True,"True.   Here's how the evaluation would occur: 1. ""not False"" evaluates to True 2. ""False or True"" evaluates to True 3. ""True and True"" evaluates to True  Therefore, the overall statement is True."
True and False or ( not False ) is,True,"True.  The expression ""True and False"" evaluates to False because the ""and"" operator requires both inputs to be True for the result to be True.   However, the expression ""(not False)"" evaluates to True because the ""not"" operator inverts the Boolean value of False to True.  So, True and False or (not False) would be equivalent to False or True, which evaluates to True."
not False or not not not not True is,True,"True.   The expression not False evaluates to True.  The expression not not not not True also evaluates to True.   So when we combine these two expressions with the OR operator, we get:  not False or not not not not True   which simplifies to:  True or not not not True   which further simplifies to:  True or not not False   Finally, not not False evaluates to False so the expression simplifies to:  True or False  which evaluates to:  True."
True and ( not ( True ) ) is,False,"False.   The expression `not (True)` evaluates to `False`. Thus, `True and (not (True))` is equivalent to `True and False`, which evaluates to `False`."
True and False and not True or False is,False,"True.  The expression can be simplified as follows:  1) ""True or False"" evaluates to True 2) ""not True"" is False 3) False and True evaluates to False.  So the final result is False or False, which is False. However, since the ""not"" operator is applied to ""True"" and not the entire expression, it should be written as ""not (True or False) and False"" to evaluate to False."
( ( not False ) ) and True is,True,"True.   In this expression, the parentheses around ""not False"" are evaluated first. Since ""not False"" evaluates to True, the expression becomes ""True and True"". And since both operands are True, the result is True."
not ( True ) and ( False ) is,False,"False.   This is because the `not` operator negates the truth value of the expression that follows it. So `not (True)` is `False`, and `(False)` on its own is `False` as well.   Then the `and` operator evaluates both expressions on its left and right and returns `True` only if both are `True`. In this case, since one is `False`, the overall expression evaluates to `False`."
True or not False and False and False is,True,False.
True and not ( False or False ) is,True,"True.  When we have `not` operator, it reverses the truth value of the expression it modifies. So `False or False` evaluates to False. Then `not False` is True, therefore the entire expression is True."
not True and False or False and True is,False,"False.  The expression evaluates as follows:  not True and False or False and True  not True => False False and False => False False or False => False  Therefore, the overall result is False."
not True or not False and not True is,False,"True  This is because the order of operations for logical operators is:  1. not 2. and 3. or  So the expression evaluates as:  1. not True = False 2. not False = True 3. False and True = False 4. not False = True  Therefore, the final result is True."
not True or False or True and True is,True,"True.   The order of operations for boolean logic is NOT, AND, then OR. So, starting from the left:   - ""not True"" evaluates to False  - ""False or True"" evaluates to True   Therefore, the final result is True."
not True and True and False and True is,False,"False.   The expression ""True and True and False and True"" evaluates to False because the ""and"" operator requires all operands to be True in order for the entire expression to be True. In this case, since one of the operands (""False"") is False, the entire expression evaluates to False."
False and False or not True and True is,False,False.   The operator precedence for this expression is:   1. not  2. and  3. or   So we evaluate it like this:   False and False = False   not True = False   True and True = True   Then:   False or True = True
( not False or False and True ) is,True,"True.  Using order of operations, we evaluate the expression as follows:  1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: False or False and True   2. Since ""and"" has higher precedence than ""or,"" we first evaluate ""False and True,"" which is False.  3. We then evaluate ""False or False,"" which is also False.  4. Finally, we negate the result of the expression inside the parentheses since it is preceeded by ""not"", giving us the final result of True."
( True or False ) or not True is,True,False.
not not not ( False ) and False is,False,"True. The first ""not"" operator negates the second ""not"" operator, which makes the expression ""False"". Then, the ""and"" operator compares ""False"" with ""False"" and returns ""True"" only if both values are True. However, in this case, both values are ""False"", so the result is ""False""."
not False and False and False and True is,False,"False  This is because the ""and"" operator requires that all inputs be True in order for the expression to return True. In this case, only the last input (""True"") is True, so the overall result is False."
False and not True and True or False is,False,"True  The order of operations for this expression is:      False and (not True) and (True or False)  The first two terms simplify to `False` and `(not True)` is equivalent to `False`.   The `True or False` term evaluates to `True`.   So the final expression is:      False and False and True      Since all terms in an `and` expression must be `True` in order for the entire expression to be `True`, this expression evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the answer is not True."
( False or not False and False ) is,False,"False.  This expression is evaluated according to the operator precedence and associativity rules:  1. First, the ""not"" operator is evaluated. 2. Then, the ""and"" operator is evaluated (from left to right). 3. Finally, the ""or"" operator is evaluated (from left to right).  So, according to these rules, the expression can be written as:  ( False or (not False and False) )  The ""not"" operator is applied to False, which returns True. Then, the ""and"" operator is evaluated between True and False, which returns False. Finally, the ""or"" operator is evaluated between False and False, which returns False."
False or ( False or not False ) is,True,"True.   The expression evaluates to True because the sub-expression ""False or not False"" evaluates to True.   ""not False"" evaluates to True, because False is inversed, resulting in True.   And ""False or True"" evaluates to True, because one of the operands is True."
not False or True or False and False is,True,"True.  The order of operations is:  1. not 2. and 3. or  So, the first operation evaluated is `not False`, which is True. Then, we have `True or True or False and False`. The next operation to evaluate is `False and False`, which is False. Then, we have `True or True or False`, which evaluates to True."
True or ( not False ) or True is,True,True.
not False and False or True or False is,True,"True  Here's how it evaluates:  1. ""not False"" evaluates to True 2. ""False or True"" evaluates to True (because at least one of them is True) 3. ""True or False"" evaluates to True (again because at least one of them is True)  So the final expression is ""True or False"", which simply evaluates to True."
False and not ( not not False ) is,False,"True.   The innermost not operation (not False) evaluates to True. The next one (not True) evaluates to False, and finally, the outermost not operation flips the value back to True. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to True."
not not ( not True ) or False is,False,"True.   The first part of the expression is evaluated as `not True`, which is `False`. Then, we have `not False`, which is `True`. Finally, we have `True` or `False`, which evaluates to `True`."
False and not True and True and False is,False,"False.   The operation `and` returns True only if both operands are True. In the given expression:  1. `False and not True` is `False` because `not True` is `False`. 2. `True and False` is `False` because both operands are not True.  Therefore, the final result will be `False`."
True or False and not ( True ) is,True,"False.   The expression ""not (True)"" evaluates to False because it means ""the opposite of True,"" which is False. Therefore, the entire expression ""True or False and not (True)"" would evaluate to True because it is saying ""either True or False (which is also true), but not True (which is false)."""
not ( False ) and ( True ) is,True,"The answer is `False`.  Here's how:  - The expression `not ( False )` evaluates to `True` because the `not` operator negates the boolean value of `False`. - The expression `( True )` evaluates to `True`. - The `and` operator evaluates to `True` if both of its operands evaluate to `True`. Since both operands in this case evaluate to `True`, the overall expression evaluates to `True`. - However, because we have a `not` operator in front of the entire expression, the final value is negated. Therefore, the overall expression evaluates to `False`."
False and not ( ( True ) ) is,False,"False, because ""not (True)"" is False, and then ""False and False"" results in False again."
not False or ( not not False ) is,True,"True.   This expression can be broken down as follows:   - ""not False"" evaluates to True.  - ""not not False"" evaluates to False.  - Combined with the ""or"" operator, we get: ""True or False"" which evaluates to True."
( ( not False ) and False ) is,False,"False.   This is a logical expression using an ""and"" operator. In this expression, the first operand is the negation of False, which is True. The second operand is simply False.   Since the ""and"" operator requires both operands to be True in order for the expression as a whole to evaluate to True, the final result is False."
True or False and not False and True is,True,"False.   ""True or False"" evaluates to True, and ""not False"" also evaluates to True. Therefore, ""True or False and not False and True"" becomes ""True or False and True"", which is True."
( ( not True and True ) ) is,False,"False.   The expression ""not True"" evaluates to False, and ""True"" is True, so ""False and True"" evaluates to False. Finally, wrapping the entire expression in an extra set of parentheses doesn't change its value. Therefore, the final result is False."
not ( False ) or not not False is,True,"""True""  The first part of the expression ""not ( False )"" will evaluate to ""True"" because the ""not"" keyword is used to negate the value of a boolean expression, which in this case is ""False"".  The second part of the expression ""not not False"" will evaluate to ""True"" as well. The first ""not"" keyword negates the value of ""False"" to ""True"", and the second ""not"" keyword negates the value again from ""True"" back to ""False"". Because the two negations cancel each other out, the resulting value is ""True"".  Finally, the entire expression is an OR operation between the two parts, with at least one of them being ""True"". Therefore, the final output as a whole is ""True""."
not ( False or False and False ) is,True,"True.   Here's how to arrive at the answer:  First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: False and False evaluates to False because both operands are False.   So we have not (False or False). Since False or False is also False (because both operands are False), not (False or False) is True because the not operator negates the False to become True."
False and not ( not not True ) is,False,"True.  To break it down:   - **not True** is False (negation of True is False)   - **not not True** is True (negation of False is True)   - **False and True** is False (False AND anything is always False)  Therefore, False and not ( not not True ) is False."
False and False and not ( True ) is,False,"False.   When evaluating this expression, we first evaluate the two ""False and False"" parts. Since both of them are False, the overall result of the ""and"" operator is also False.   Then we evaluate the ""not"" operator that negates the result of the expression in the parentheses, which is True. So the final result is False.   Putting it all together:   ``` False and False and not (True) = False and False and False = False ```"
False or ( not False and False ) is,False,"False.   First, the expression inside the parentheses evaluates as `not False and False` which is `False and False` and equals `False`.  Then, the entire expression becomes `False or False` which equals `False`."
False or ( not not not True ) is,False,"False.   The expression ""not not not True"" is equivalent to ""not not False"", which in turn is equivalent to ""not True"". Therefore, the original expression can be rewritten as ""False or not True"", which evaluates to False."
( not False ) or not not False is,True,"True.   This is because ""not False"" evaluates to True, and ""not not False"" is the same as ""not True"", which also evaluates to False.   So the full expression "" ( not False ) or not not False"" can be simplified to ""True or False"", which is True."
not False and False and True or False is,False,"False.   Here is the order in which the Boolean operators are evaluated:  1. not 2. and 3. or  So, the expression ""not False"" evaluates to True. Then, ""True and False"" evaluates to False. Finally, ""False or False"" evaluates to False."
True or not False and ( False ) is,True,"False.   The statement ""True or not False"" is True, and the statement inside the brackets ""False"" is also False. When you combine the two statements using ""and"", the result is False because both of the statements are not True."
( not ( False ) ) or False is,True,"True.   The expression `not (False)` evaluates to `True`, since `False` is negated by the `not` operator.   Then the expression `True or False` evaluates to `True`, since at least one of the operands evaluates to `True`."
True and not True or False and True is,False,"True.  The order of operations in this expression is:  1. Evaluate ""not True"", which is False. 2. Evaluate ""True or False"", which is True. 3. Evaluate ""False and True"", which is False. 4. Evaluate ""True and False"", which is False.  Therefore, the overall result of the expression is True."
not ( not not not not False ) is,True,"True.  When we have a double negative, like ""not not,"" it cancels out to be a positive. Therefore, if we have five ""nots"" followed by False, it will be True.   ""Not False"" is True. ""Not not False"" is False, so ""not not not False"" is True. Similarly, ""not not not not False"" is False, so ""not not not not not False"" is True."
True and ( not True or False ) is,False,"True.  This is because of the order of operations in logic. First, we evaluate the part inside the parentheses: ""not True"" is False, and ""True or False"" is True. So we have ""True and True"", which evaluates to True."
( not not not False or True ) is,True,"True.   The order of precedence for logical operators is NOT > AND > OR. In this case, the double negation (not not) cancel each other out, leaving us with ""False or True"". For an OR condition to be True, at least one of the operands must be True. Since ""True"" is one of the operands here, the final result is True."
