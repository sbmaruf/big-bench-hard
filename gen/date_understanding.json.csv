(E) 01/26/2009
(F) 02/15/2009",(B),"Since Jane visits the bookstore every 16th of the month, we can find the date of her first visit by adding 16 days to the last day of September 2009: September 30, 2009 + 16 days = October 16, 2009.  Since Jane visits the bookstore every month, we can find the date of her visit one year ago by subtracting one year from today's date and checking which visit that would be. Today is in 2020, so one year ago would be 2019.  2019 is 10 years after 2009, so Jane had made 10 visits to the bookstore by the end of September 2019, and her 5th visit was in March 2019 (10 visits - 5 visits = 5 visits before September 2019). Therefore, her 5th visit in 2019 was on March 16, 2019.  To find the date one year before this, we subtract one year from March 16, 2019, giving us March 16, 2018.

If 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on March 20th, 2020, then we can subtract 176 from today's date to get March 20th, 2020.

(F) 01/03/2020",(B),"Since today's date is a palindrome, it must be in the form $ABCCBACBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits (note that $A$ cannot be zero). We know that $C$ must be 2 since the date is in January. Then $A$ and $B$ must be 0, 1, or 2. If $B$ were 2, then the date would be February 22, which is invalid since February only has 29 days in a leap year, and 2020 is a leap year. Therefore, $B$ is either 0 or 1.  Now, we can consider the date a month ago. If $B$ is 0, then the date would be 1220220, which is not a valid date. Therefore, $B$ must be 1, and the date would be 1212120.

However, we need to take into account that there are leap years in between, which means there are 50 years + 12 leap years = 50 + 12 = 62 total years passed.   To calculate the number of days in 62 years, we can simply do 365 x 62 + 16 (including the leap years) = 22,792 days.   Adding 10 days to their anniversary date, we get 01/12/1958.   Going back to the present day (which we can assume is in 2018), we need to add 60 years to their anniversary year to get 2018 - 1958 + 60 = 120.

(E) 01/23/2011",(B),"Today's date is 02/02/2020. To find the date 10 days ago, we can simply subtract 10 from the day value: 02 - 10 = -8. However, this is not a valid day value. Instead, we can subtract 10 from the date using modular arithmetic: 02 - 10 = 16 (mod 31).

(F) 11/30/2019",(F),"If today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, then she started working on a date three years ago that is exactly 365 days before today's date. To figure that out, we need to subtract 3 years from today's date. However, we must be careful with leap years. 2016 was a leap year, so we need to add 1 day to account for February 29th. Therefore, Jane's start date was:  365 days/year * 2 years + 366 days (for the leap year 2016) = 1096 days  Subtracting 1096 days from today's date, we get:  11/30/2019 - 1096 days = 02/18/2016  Dec 2 is 4 days after Jane's start date. Subtracting 4 days from 02/18/2016, we get:  02/14/2016  Therefore, yesterday's date was February 14, 2016 or 02/14/2016. The answer is (F) 11/30/2019."

(E) 03/05/1973
(F) 03/08/1983",(E),"Since Jane is observing her second meteor shower of the year and there is only one meteor shower per month, it must be at least February 1st. Since today is the fifth day of her second meteor shower, we know that the first day of her second meteor shower was February 1st (or possibly later), which means her first meteor shower was in January.  Now we need to count the number of days from January 1, 1973 to February 1, 1973. January has 31 days, so there are 31 days from January 1st to January 31st, and then 1 more day from January 31st to February 1st. This means that February 1st is the 32nd day of the year.  Since today is the fifth day of Jane's second meteor shower, we need to add 5 days to February 1st. Using a calendar or counting, we find that February 2nd is the 33rd day of the year, February 3rd is the 34th day, February 4th is the 35th day, and February 5th is the 36th day.  Therefore, today's date is 02/05/1973. Answer (B) is the closest option, but it is not correct."

(E) 01/01/1891
(F) 01/01/1929",(F),"One year ago from today is the same date, but in the previous year. Since today is not a leap year, we cannot just subtract 1 from the year. Instead, we have to keep in mind that the year changed, and that February has fewer days in non-leap years. December 31, 1929 was a Tuesday, so December 31, 1930 was a Wednesday.   Thus, working backwards, we know that the previous year was 1929. January 31, 1929 was a Thursday. Since 1929 was not a leap year, February had 28 days, so February 28, 1929 was a Thursday. March 31, April 30, and May 31 all fell on different weekdays as well, and June 30, 1929 was a Sunday. For all these months, we have to work forwards, since we are going backwards from December 31, 1930.   For instance: April 30, 1929 (a Wednesday) was 214 days before December 31. Since there are 7 days in a week, we know that the weekday 214 days later will be the same as the weekday 6 days later. Going forward from April 30, we get May 1 (a Thursday), June 1 (a Saturday), July 1 (a Monday), August 1 (a Thursday), September 1 (a Sunday), October 1 (a Tuesday), November 1 (a Friday), and finally December 1 (a Sunday). Since December 1, 1929 is 30 days behind December 31, 1929, we know that December 1, 1929 was a Sunday. We can also see that the same pattern holds for the other months:   | Month | Date | Weekday | |-------|------|---------| | Jan   | 31   | Thurs   | | Feb   | 28   | Thurs   | | Mar   | 31   | Sun     | | Apr   | 30   | Tues    | | May   | 31   | Fri     | | Jun   | 30   | Sun     | | Jul   | 31   | Wed     | | Aug   | 31   | Sat     | | Sep   | 30   | Mon     | | Oct   | 31   | Thu     | | Nov   | 30   | Sat     | | Dec   | 1    | Sun     |  Therefore, one year ago from today was 01/01/1929, which is option $\boxed{\textbf{(F)}}$."

Let's suppose her first time was on 1/1 (the actual date doesn't matter for this problem).   Since she sees the meteor shower every $365$ days, her next time seeing it will be $365$ days later, on 1/1 + 365 days = 12/31.   To find the date that is $10$ days before 12/31, we subtract $10$ from the day to get 12/21.   However, we need to make sure this date is in 1973. Since 1973 is not a leap year, December only has $31 - 5 = 26$ days after March. Therefore, 12/21 is still in 1973.   The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }02/23/1973}$."

(F) 01/29/2016",(F),"Since 2000 is a leap year, February has 29 days. Jane's birthday this year would be on February 29, 2016, and her 16-year-old birthday would be on February 28 (since there is no February 29th on a non-leap year). Therefore, a month ago would be January 28, 2016. The answer is $\boxed{\text{(F) } 01/29/2016}$."
